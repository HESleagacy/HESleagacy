# Hi, I'm Sarva 👋

I’m a Computer Science & Data Science undergraduate focused on building
**backend systems**, **ML-powered APIs**, and
**open-source-ready software**.

I enjoy working close to real systems: APIs, data pipelines, model serving,
and infrastructure that actually survives contact with users.

---

## 🔭 What I’m Working On
- Backend services using **FastAPI** and **PostgreSQL**
- ML pipelines for training, inference, and deployment
- Containerized systems using **Docker** and basic **DevOps workflows**
- Open-source contributions and GSoC-oriented projects

---

## 🌱 Currently Learning
- System design for scalable APIs
- MLOps fundamentals (model versioning, deployment, monitoring)
- Cloud-native tooling (Docker, Kubernetes basics)
- Clean open-source collaboration practices
