# Hi, I'm Sarva 👋

I’m a **Computer Science & Data Science** undergraduate focused on building **backend systems**, **ML-powered APIs**, and **open-source-ready software**.

I enjoy working close to the "metal" of data: APIs, pipelines, model serving, and infrastructure that actually survives contact with real-world users.

### 🔭 What I’m Working On

* 🚀 **Backend Services:** Crafting high-performance APIs with **FastAPI** & **PostgreSQL**.
* 🤖 **ML Pipelines:** Automating the journey from raw data to production-ready inference.
* 📦 **Infrastructure:** Building containerized systems using **Docker** and modern **DevOps** workflows.
* 🌍 **Open Source:** Actively contributing and preparing for **GSoC-oriented** projects.
